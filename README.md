- Version 1.0
- Deployment date: Oct 7, 2021

## Concept
As a fan of an artist, our application allows the user to search the lyrics of a song and gives links to the artistâ€™s platforms and upcoming concerts/events.

## Instructions

1. Search for an artist and song using correct spelling. Click the "ROCK ON" button.

3. Find applicable social media links and upcoming events/concerts on right or bottom card (depending on screen size)
4. Scroll back to top using "TOP" button to search for another song.

## Ice Box
Ideas for future development:
1. Getting music streaming services or video streaming integrated like: Shazam, Spotify, youTube, karaoke
2. Overriding Materialize colors
3. Duplicating search history
4. Better functions for misspelled artist/songs
5. Filter events based off user location
